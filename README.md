## DocuScope and Part-of-Speech tagging with spaCy

This application is designed for the analysis of small corpora assisted by part-of-speech and rhetorical tagging.

With the application users can:

1. process small corpora
2. create frequency tables of words, phrases, and tags
3. calculate associations around node words
4. generate key word in context (KWIC) tables
5. compare corpora or sub-corpora
6. explore single texts
7. practice advanced plotting
